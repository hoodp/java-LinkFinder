<p class="ordinary" id="id1">Four score and <span class="special" id="id2">seven</span> years ago our <span
        class="special" id="id3">fathers brought forth</span> on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and
    dedicated to the proposition that <span class="ordinary" id="id4"> all men </span> are created equal.</p>

<div class="special" id="id9"><p class="special" id="id15">Now we <span class="special" id="id15b">are engaged in a <em
        class="special" id="id16">great civil war</em>, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure</span>.
    We are met on <em class="ordinary" id="id10">a <b class="special" id="id13"> great</b> battle-field of that
        war.</em> We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave
    their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.</p> But, in a
    larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men,
    living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will
    little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the
    living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly
    advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored
    dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here
    highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of
    freedom -- and
    that government
